# Analytical Lambda Calculus: Mathematical Foundations

## Overview

This document provides a detailed mathematical treatment of lambda calculus and its analytical properties, complementing the implementation in this repository.

## 1. Syntax and Semantics

### 1.1 Lambda Terms

The set of lambda terms Λ is defined inductively:

```
M, N ::= x           (variable)
       | λx.M        (abstraction)
       | M N         (application)
```

### 1.2 Free and Bound Variables

**Free Variables** FV(M):
- FV(x) = {x}
- FV(λx.M) = FV(M) \ {x}
- FV(M N) = FV(M) ∪ FV(N)

**Bound Variables** BV(M):
- BV(x) = ∅
- BV(λx.M) = BV(M) ∪ {x}
- BV(M N) = BV(M) ∪ BV(N)

## 2. Operational Semantics

### 2.1 Beta Reduction (β-reduction)

The fundamental computation rule:

```
(λx.M) N →β M[x := N]
```

Where M[x := N] denotes the capture-avoiding substitution of N for all free occurrences of x in M.

**Formal Definition of Substitution:**

```
x[x := N] = N
y[x := N] = y                                    (if y ≠ x)
(M₁ M₂)[x := N] = (M₁[x := N]) (M₂[x := N])
(λx.M)[x := N] = λx.M
(λy.M)[x := N] = λy.(M[x := N])                 (if y ≠ x and y ∉ FV(N))
(λy.M)[x := N] = λz.(M[y := z][x := N])        (if y ≠ x and y ∈ FV(N), z fresh)
```

### 2.2 Alpha Conversion (α-conversion)

Renaming of bound variables:

```
λx.M =α λy.M[x := y]    (where y ∉ FV(M) and y is fresh)
```

**Properties:**
- Preserves semantic equivalence
- Necessary for capture-avoiding substitution
- Forms equivalence classes of terms

### 2.3 Eta Conversion (η-conversion)

Function extensionality:

```
λx.(M x) =η M    (where x ∉ FV(M))
```

**Properties:**
- Expresses that two functions are equal if they give the same results
- Can be used for both reduction (→η) and expansion (←η)

## 3. Reduction Strategies

### 3.1 Normal Order Reduction

Always reduce the leftmost-outermost redex first.

**Theorem (Standardization):** If a term has a normal form, normal order reduction will find it.

### 3.2 Applicative Order Reduction

Always reduce the leftmost-innermost redex first.

**Note:** May not terminate even when a normal form exists.

### 3.3 Call-by-Name vs Call-by-Value

- **Call-by-Name:** Do not reduce under abstractions; corresponds to lazy evaluation
- **Call-by-Value:** Reduce arguments before substitution; corresponds to eager evaluation

## 4. Confluence and Normalization

### 4.1 Church-Rosser Theorem

If M →* N₁ and M →* N₂, then there exists N₃ such that:
```
N₁ →* N₃ and N₂ →* N₃
```

**Corollary:** A term has at most one normal form (up to α-equivalence).

### 4.2 Normal Forms

A term M is in **normal form** if no β-reduction applies to M.

A term M is in **weak head normal form (WHNF)** if:
- M = λx.N, or
- M = x M₁ ... Mₙ (neutral term)

### 4.3 Strong Normalization

A term is **strongly normalizing** if all reduction sequences starting from it are finite.

**Note:** Not all lambda terms are strongly normalizing (e.g., Ω = (λx.x x)(λx.x x)).

## 5. Church Encodings

### 5.1 Natural Numbers

Church numerals represent numbers as higher-order functions:

```
0 := λf.λx.x
1 := λf.λx.f x
2 := λf.λx.f (f x)
n := λf.λx.fⁿ x
```

**Successor Function:**
```
SUCC := λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)
```

**Arithmetic Operations:**
```
ADD := λm.λn.λf.λx.m f (n f x)
MULT := λm.λn.λf.m (n f)
EXP := λm.λn.n m
```

### 5.2 Boolean Values

```
TRUE := λt.λf.t
FALSE := λt.λf.f
```

**Logical Operations:**
```
AND := λp.λq.p q p
OR := λp.λq.p p q
NOT := λp.λt.λf.p f t
IF := λp.λt.λe.p t e
```

### 5.3 Pairs and Tuples

```
PAIR := λx.λy.λf.f x y
FST := λp.p TRUE
SND := λp.p FALSE
```

### 5.4 Lists

```
NIL := λc.λn.n
CONS := λh.λt.λc.λn.c h (t c n)
```

## 6. Fixed-Point Combinators

### 6.1 Y Combinator

```
Y := λf.(λx.f (x x))(λx.f (x x))
```

**Property:**
```
Y F = F (Y F)
```

This enables recursion:
```
FACT := Y (λf.λn.IF (ISZERO n) 1 (MULT n (f (PRED n))))
```

### 6.2 Turing's Fixed-Point Combinator

```
Θ := (λx.λy.y (x x y))(λx.λy.y (x x y))
```

## 7. Analytical Properties

### 7.1 Redex Analysis

A **beta-redex** is a term of the form (λx.M) N.

**Counting Redexes:**
- Measures computational complexity
- Determines number of reduction steps needed
- Useful for optimization analysis

### 7.2 Term Size Metrics

**Size:** Number of nodes in the abstract syntax tree
```
size(x) = 1
size(λx.M) = 1 + size(M)
size(M N) = 1 + size(M) + size(N)
```

**Depth:** Maximum nesting level
```
depth(x) = 0
depth(λx.M) = 1 + depth(M)
depth(M N) = 1 + max(depth(M), depth(N))
```

### 7.3 Reduction Complexity

For a term M, define:
- **Reduction length:** Number of β-reduction steps to reach normal form
- **Reduction tree:** Tree of all possible reduction sequences

**Examples:**
- Church numeral n has size O(n) but can be produced in O(1) reductions
- Some terms grow exponentially during reduction

## 8. Type Systems (Brief Overview)

### 8.1 Simply Typed Lambda Calculus

Add types to prevent non-termination:

```
τ ::= α | τ₁ → τ₂
```

**Typing Rules:**
```
Γ, x:τ ⊢ x:τ                           (Var)
Γ, x:τ₁ ⊢ M:τ₂ ⇒ Γ ⊢ λx.M:τ₁→τ₂        (Abs)
Γ ⊢ M:τ₁→τ₂  Γ ⊢ N:τ₁ ⇒ Γ ⊢ M N:τ₂     (App)
```

**Properties:**
- All well-typed terms strongly normalize
- Type inference is decidable

### 8.2 System F (Polymorphic Lambda Calculus)

Adds universal quantification over types:

```
τ ::= α | τ₁ → τ₂ | ∀α.τ
```

## 9. Computational Completeness
