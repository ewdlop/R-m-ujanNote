- **Analysis Tools**: Redex counting, term size calculation, reduction tracking

### What is Lambda Calculus?

Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It serves as the foundation for functional programming languages and provides a framework for studying computability.

### Features

#### 1. Lambda Terms

Three types of terms are supported:

- **Variables** (`Var`): `x`, `y`, `z`, etc.
- **Abstractions** (`Abs`): `λx.M` - function definitions
- **Applications** (`App`): `M N` - function applications

#### 2. Analytical Operations

- **Beta Reduction**: `(λx.M) N → M[x := N]` - function application
- **Alpha Conversion**: `λx.M → λy.M[x := y]` - variable renaming
- **Eta Conversion**: `λx.(M x) → M` - function extensionality
- **Normalization**: Reduce terms to normal form

#### 3. Church Encodings

The implementation includes Church encodings for:

- **Natural Numbers**: `0 = λf.λx.x`, `1 = λf.λx.f x`, `2 = λf.λx.f(f x)`, etc.
- **Booleans**: `true = λt.λf.t`, `false = λt.λf.f`
- **Arithmetic**: successor, addition, multiplication
- **Logic**: AND, OR, NOT operations

#### 4. Analysis Tools

- Count beta-redexes in a term
- Calculate term size
- Track reduction sequences
- Check for normal form

### Usage

#### Basic Examples

```python
from lambda_calculus import Var, Abs, App, beta_reduce, normalize

# Identity function: λx.x
identity = Abs("x", Var("x"))

# Apply identity to a variable
applied = App(identity, Var("a"))
print(applied)  # (λx.x) a

# Beta reduce
result = beta_reduce(applied)
print(result)  # a
```

#### Church Numerals

```python
from lambda_calculus import church_numeral, church_add, normalize

# Create Church numerals
one = church_numeral(1)
two = church_numeral(2)

# Add them
add = church_add()
result = normalize(App(App(add, one), two))
print(result)  # (λf.(λx.f (f (f x)))) - Church numeral 3
```

#### Boolean Logic

```python
from lambda_calculus import church_true, church_false, church_and, normalize

# Boolean operations
true = church_true()
false = church_false()
and_op = church_and()

# Compute true AND false
result = normalize(App(App(and_op, true), false))
print(result)  # (λt.(λf.f)) - Church encoding of false
```

### Running Examples

To see comprehensive examples of analytical lambda calculus:

```bash
python3 examples.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Identity and constant functions
- Alpha and eta conversions
- Substitution with capture avoidance
- Church numerals and arithmetic
- Boolean operations
- The Omega combinator (non-terminating computation)
- Y combinator for recursion
- Analytical operations on various terms

### Mathematical Background

#### Beta Reduction

The core computational rule of lambda calculus:

```
(λx.M) N → M[x := N]
```

This substitutes all free occurrences of `x` in `M` with `N`.

#### Alpha Conversion

Renaming bound variables to avoid naming conflicts:

```
λx.M → λy.M[x := y]  (where y is fresh)
```

#### Eta Conversion

Expressing function extensionality:

```
λx.(M x) → M  (if x ∉ FV(M))
```

### Implementation Details

- **Capture-Avoiding Substitution**: The implementation automatically handles variable capture by performing alpha conversion when necessary
- **Normal Form**: Terms are reduced to normal form using leftmost-outermost (normal order) reduction
- **Non-Termination**: The system correctly handles non-terminating computations like the Omega combinator

### Mathematical Properties

The implementation preserves important properties:

1. **Confluence (Church-Rosser)**: Different reduction sequences lead to the same normal form
2. **Capture Avoidance**: Substitution respects variable binding
3. **Alpha Equivalence**: Terms differing only in bound variable names are equivalent
4. **Turing Completeness**: Lambda calculus with recursion (Y combinator) is Turing complete
