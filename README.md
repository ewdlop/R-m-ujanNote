   The names Rāmāṉujan (Srinivasa Ramanujan), Hardy (G. H. Hardy), and Littlewood (J. E. Littlewood) are linked by one of the most famous and productive collaborations in the history of mathematics, primarily at the University of Cambridge in the early 20th century.

Here are the key aspects of their relationship and contributions:

* **Discovery and Mentorship:** G. H. Hardy recognized the extraordinary, intuitive, but largely untrained genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan after receiving a letter from him in 1913. Hardy arranged for Ramanujan to come from India to Cambridge, where he became Hardy's protégé and collaborator.
* **The Trio:** J. E. Littlewood was Hardy's long-time, immensely productive collaborator. Littlewood played a crucial, though sometimes behind-the-scenes, role in assessing Ramanujan's initial theorems with Hardy and in the collaborative work that followed. Hardy and Littlewood's own collaboration was so well-known that the Danish mathematician Harald Bohr once joked, "Nowadays, there are only three really great English Mathematicians: Hardy, Littlewood, and Hardy-Littlewood."
* **The Circle Method (Hardy–Ramanujan–Littlewood Circle Method):**
    * This is arguably their most famous joint creation.
    * It originated with **Hardy and Ramanujan** in a series of papers (1917–1918) to find the **asymptotic formula for the partition function** ($p(n)$), which counts the number of ways a positive integer $n$ can be written as a sum of positive integers.
    * The technique was then further developed and applied by **Hardy and Littlewood** to solve **Waring's problem** (representing a number as a sum of powers) and the **Goldbach Conjecture** (representing a number as a sum of primes), greatly advancing analytic number theory.
* **Hardy and Ramanujan's Shared Work:** They published several important joint papers, most notably the work on the partition function and the Hardy–Ramanujan asymptotic formula.
* **Littlewood's Influence:** Littlewood was critical in the early assessment of Ramanujan's notebooks and theorems, helping Hardy discern which results were known, which were wrong, and which were groundbreaking. Littlewood also worked with Hardy to provide the necessary mathematical rigor to Ramanujan's brilliant, but often unproven, insights.

In summary, Hardy was the primary mentor and direct collaborator with Ramanujan, while Littlewood was Hardy's established, crucial partner, making the body of work a combined legacy of all three, with the **Circle Method** being the prime example of their collective impact on mathematics.
